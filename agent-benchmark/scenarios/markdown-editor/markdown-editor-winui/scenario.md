I need a markdown editor for Windows — something clean and native-feeling, not an Electron wrapper.

The main thing is a split view: I want to write markdown on the left and see the rendered preview on the right, updating live as I type. Needs to handle all the standard markdown — headings, bold, italic, code blocks, links, images, lists. Use WebView2 for the preview.

Tab support is essential — I always have multiple files open. Standard file operations with the usual Windows shortcuts. If I close a tab without saving, warn me. I also want the ability to switch between editor-only, preview-only, and split modes.

Find (Ctrl+F) with highlighting, a status bar with line/column/word count, and undo/redo per tab. Recent files should appear in the taskbar JumpList so I can right-click and jump straight to a file. A Settings page for font size and preview theme would be nice.

Make it feel like it belongs on Windows — Fluent Design, proper menu bar, keyboard shortcuts, native look.
