Build me a system settings and dashboard app — like a simplified Windows Settings.

Requirements:
- WinUI 3 desktop app with Fluent Design (Mica backdrop, custom title bar)
- NavigationView on the left with at least 4 pages: Dashboard, Appearance, Network, About
- Dashboard page: system info cards showing OS version, machine name, CPU, RAM. A NumberBox to set auto-refresh interval (1-60 seconds)
- Appearance page: ToggleSwitch for dark/light theme (applies immediately), ComboBox for accent color (5+ options), Slider for font size with live preview, RadioButtons for spacing mode (Compact/Normal/Comfortable)
- Network page: ListView showing network adapters with columns (name, type, status, IP). AutoSuggestBox to filter by name. Expander for each adapter showing detailed info (subnet, gateway, DNS)
- About page: app version, build info, HyperlinkButtons for links
- ContentDialog for "Reset all settings" confirmation
- All interactive controls need AutomationProperties.AutomationId
- Frame-based page navigation
- Make sure the app builds and runs
