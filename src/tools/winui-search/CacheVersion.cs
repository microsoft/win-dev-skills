/// <summary>
/// Single source of truth for the on-disk cache version under
/// <c>%LOCALAPPDATA%\winui-search\cache\</c>. Both <see cref="GalleryFetcher"/>
/// and <see cref="ToolkitFetcher"/> stamp this string into their
/// <c>schema-version.txt</c> on write and require an exact match on read;
/// any mismatch forces a cache miss + rebuild from embedded fallback JSON.
///
/// Bump <see cref="Current"/> whenever ANY cached payload should be discarded:
///   1. Scenario / tag JSON schema changes (new or removed fields)
///   2. Embedded <c>Data/*.json</c> content changes (e.g. new tags added,
///      tag-list contents widened) — bump even if the C# schema is unchanged,
///      otherwise existing caches keep serving the older fallback contents.
///   3. Tag extraction / cleaning logic changes that would alter the cached
///      output for the same input data.
///
/// History:
///   "10" — Notes / Synonyms refactor
///   "11" — Added chip/token/tag entries to tokenizingtextbox in toolkit-tags.json
///   "12" — Added StopWords.TagOnly (text/input/layout/pick/basics/advanced)
///          → tag dicts cleansed; query tokens unchanged.
///   "13" — Toolkit cache now written CLEAN (CleanTagDictionary applied
///          before serialize), matching GalleryFetcher behavior. Old caches
///          contained polluted toolkit tags that were only filtered on read.
///   "14" — Plan A: separate keywords.json cache file; Plan B: HeaderText
///          is now the Sample's Header attribute alone (no " — Description"
///          suffix), Description holds the .md paragraph or XAML Description
///          attribute as a fallback.
///   "15" — Toolkit CleanCSharp now folds platform #if/#else/#endif (keeps
///          WINAPPSDK branch, drops UWP/Uno fallbacks) so emitted samples
///          compile clean against WinAppSDK without the noisy preprocessor.
///   "16" — Toolkit scenario IDs now renumbered in stable sample-path order
///          (was: alphabetical-by-slug, which reshuffled when upstream
///          rewords a Header). Old caches still resolve correctly inside a
///          single process but {controlId}-{N} differs across versions.
