# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`WUI1001` / `WUI1002` — Data-driven UWP→WinAppSDK API mapping rules**
  sourced from the [Microsoft Learn API mapping table](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/migrate-to-windows-app-sdk/api-mapping-table).
  ~30 mappings shipped; adding more is a data PR (one row in `ApiMappings.g.cs` + one test).
- **`WUI1010` — Migration feature-area hints (Info)** sourced from the
  [feature mapping table](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/migrate-to-windows-app-sdk/feature-mapping-table).
- **`ProjectContext` detector** — gates `WUI1xxx` to projects classified as
  `MigratingFromUwp` (heuristics: `Package.appxmanifest` AdditionalFile, `Windows.UI.*`
  using directives). Greenfield WinUI 3 projects see no migration noise.
- **`Allowlists.cs`** — declarative per-rule carve-outs replacing inline string literals.
  Now covers `GetForCurrentView`, `Window.Current`, UWP-XAML namespace false friends,
  and the WebView2 containing-type guard.
- **`SuppressionTests.cs`** — pragma-suppression regression test for every shipping rule
  (11 tests). A rule that doesn't honor `#pragma warning disable` will turn this red.
- **Corpus regression suite** — [`tools/run-corpus.ps1`](tools/run-corpus.ps1) clones a
  curated set of open-source WinUI 3 apps, injects the analyzer, and reports every
  diagnostic. Wired to a weekly CI job in `.github/workflows/corpus.yml`.
- **Release pipeline** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds, packs, optionally signs
  (placeholder), publishes to NuGet on a `v*` tag, and creates a GitHub Release. Manual
  dry-run available via workflow_dispatch.

### Changed
- `UwpApiAnalyzer.GetForCurrentView` heuristic now consults `Allowlists`
  instead of inline `Contains("ConnectedAnimationService")` — same behavior, easier to
  extend, regression-tested.

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- Initial release as a standalone NuGet package, extracted from the
  `microsoft/win-dev-skills` repository.
- Categorized diagnostic ID methodology (`WUI0xxx` compat / `WUI1xxx` migration /
  `WUI2xxx` runtime / `WUI3xxx` MVVM / `WUI4xxx` interop). See `RULES.md`.
- 17 diagnostics across the 5 categories.
- xUnit + `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Analyzer.Testing` test harness with
  positive / negative / false-positive-guard tests per rule.
- GitHub Actions CI: build + test + pack on every PR.

### Changed
- **All `Error`-severity rules downgraded to `Warning`** (or `Info` for
  `WUI2020`) to honor the new severity ceiling. Builds will not fail by default.
  Users opt into build-breaking enforcement per-rule via `.editorconfig`.
- Diagnostic categories standardized to the `WinUI3.<Category>` form
  (`WinUI3.Compatibility`, `WinUI3.Runtime`, `WinUI3.Mvvm`, `WinUI3.Interop`).
- `helpLinkUri` populated for every rule, pointing to the corresponding section
  in `RULES.md`.

### Migration from in-tree `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.Analyzers` (legacy IDs `WUI001..WUI021`)
See the migration table in `RULES.md`. Legacy IDs are retired and not reused.
